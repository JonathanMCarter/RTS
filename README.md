# Overview
An ongoing RTS game mechanic project, the idea being to make all the mechanics needed for an RTS game without following tutorials where possible. This is mostly a passion project to test my abilites and also make a game project that could turn into an actual RTS in the future.

## Goals
The idea is to make all the mechanics for an RTS game, I'm basing this on one of my childhood favorite games, Command & Conquer Red Alert 2. Below are the mechanics I plan to make and where I'm currently at with their development:

#### Basic Controls
* Camera movement, screen edge.
* Camera movement, middle mouse click & drag.
* Camera movement, zoom in and out (want to add, it was not in RA2).
* Left click, select unit.
* Left click -> drag -> release, select units in a 2D box. 
* Left click, with selected unit(s), AI movement
* Left click, with building queue selected, place building over highlighted area if free
* Left click, placed building, 
* Right click, deselect all

#### AI 
* Ore Miners, find, collect and return with ore
* Unit movement, navigate around obsticles to reach target position
* Target and attack nearby enemies by deafult
* Attack selected target

There is a fair bit more to add here, but above is a good start to what I plan to do on this project.
